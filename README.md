# Passaporto

In 2023, [obtaining a new passport in Italy became almost impossible](https://www.rainews.it/tgr/piemonte/articoli/2023/06/passaporti-torino-una-delle-sei-citta-italiane-dove-e-impossibile-ottenere-un-appuntamento-36e9ab06-6222-4444-91ed-ab9ee9d9c806.html) for millions of residents living in some of the nation's major cities because of an overwhelming surge in passport requests. As soon as an appointment becomes available on the local city government's website it gets claimed within minutes or less, even for dates six months or more into the future.  
At the time of writing this, the situation has been going on for almost 10 months and shows no signs of slowing down.

This Go code checks for appointments available to people living in Padova, and uses a Telegram bot to send a message to our group chat as soon as it finds a spot. Getting on the website as soon as you receive the notification you're almost guaranteed to land an appointment.   
The code runs 24/7 on the free plan of render.com.
